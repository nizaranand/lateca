The Standard Wordpress Theme

The name of this theme is The Standard but I doubt it's really a standard theme.  The driving force behind the creation of The Standard (I know…a highly creative name) was to offer comprehensive administration area for maximum and easy-as-pie customization.  Also, it was important to offer a professional layout, based on a highly flexible grid (The Golden Grid by Vladimir Carrer), that also integrates a blog.  The slider is jquery powered and also integrated in the admin area, where you can choose however many posts you wish to display on the front area.  The images automatically resize so you don't have to mess with any resizing or cropping or any of that nonsense.  The menu at the top has a built in superfish dropdown capability, which is nice (and cool).  There is a built in contact form, so no plugin is required. The layout was specially, and painstakingly carved out in order to allow as much creative flexibility as any corporate or business may choose to use it - such as offering the "our amazing team" section where you could display particular team members and their accomplishments or a list of general services that a company offers.  Of course, in the admin area, the header can be changed - no problem.  And if that isn't enough, notice the unique "flash" when entering the main and subsequent pages…we thought that added a bit of flare.  And the really cool thing is…there isn't much you need to do to get this thing rolling.  From the beginning, it was our intention to make sure the fewest number of plugins was used, in order to make the set-up as simple and standard as possible.  Enjoy.
